# PCode-Dump
This repo contains a simple Ghidra Low P-Code dumping script. Its quality is not guaranteed.

# Usage

It's a java ghidra script. I suggest you clone this repo somewhere convient and then softlink the `.java` file into the user script directory, likely `~/ghidra_scripts`. The script should appear in the Pcode section.
